Power Plant Machine Learning Pipeline Application -EdX - Lab1- Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark


This notebook is an end-to-end exercise of performing Extract-Transform-Load and Exploratory Data Analysis on a real-world dataset, and then applying several different machine learning algorithms to solve a supervised regression problem on the dataset.

** This notebook covers: **
* *Part 1: Business Understanding*
* *Part 2: Load Your Data*
* *Part 3: Explore Your Data*
* *Part 4: Visualize Your Data*
* *Part 5: Data Preparation*
* *Part 6: Data Modeling*
* *Part 7: Tuning and Evaluation*

*Our goal is to accurately predict power output given a set of environmental readings from various sensors in a natural gas-fired power generation plant.*
